# SimpleDataflow&lt;T&gt;.BoundedCapacity method

Sets the bounded capacity for the next blocks.

```csharp
public SimpleDataflow BoundedCapacity(int value)
```

## Remarks

Use this setting to avoid running out of memory while earlier blocks wait for later blocks. If this method is not called, the default is `DataflowBlockOptions.Unbounded`.
